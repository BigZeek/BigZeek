## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a St. Cloud State University student looking to break into the world of software development. 

While I may have been a late bloomer to the world of software, the passion and ambition I pride myself 
on keeps me coming back to learn and grow. 

Many of the projects you see here are done for various classes, but I'm working on something I think fans of 
deep work will really enjoy! 

I hope you find some interesting code while you are here!
